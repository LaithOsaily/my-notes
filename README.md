 One of the **best things** I learned from the resource **this equation D=V/E** that will help me make a better decision  :-
  

- **The desirability of a change (D)**: How much do you want that change to happen?

- **The value of a change (V)**: How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?

- **The effort required to perform the change (E)**: How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
